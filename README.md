# Asrock WRX90 EVO + CaseLabs S8
Final version, lower DDR5 temperatures by approximately 10C. This design assumes a 25mm spacer is between case and 140mm fan mount.

* [v8-140Fan-DIMM-AirDuct](AsrockWRX90Evo-CaseLabsS8/v8-140Fan-DIMM-AirDuct.stl)
* 25mm spacer used to lower noise due to turbulent air flow [140mm to 120mm](AsrockWRX90Evo-CaseLabsS8/140to120-fan-adapter.stl)
   * Not designed by me. Unsure where this design came from.
